            <p>HyperLoot employs 2 types of tokens – ERC20 tokens for staking and transactions (or HLT tokens) and an ERC721 master node or mining tokens (or HLPTM tokens).</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>The combined valuation of all HLT in circulation at any given time period consists of four major blocks:</p>
            <p>
              First, the combined value of all HLT locked up, for the purchases of MasterNodes via HLTM master node token.<br>
              Second, the combined value of all HLT tokens staked for the purposes of in-game asset emission.<br>
              Third, the combined value of P2P clearing&settlement partners that may want to provide financial liquidity to the global P2P marketplace.<br>
              Fourth, the size of transactions that will take place on HyperLoot layer over Ethereum. These can be: (exchange, barter, loan, collateral, betting custody).

            <p>There are a few ways:</p>
            <p>
              Receive them as a reward for participating in the DAO. It’s pretty simple – you do the work, you get the tokens as a payment. Every token you own is a part of the system, so you get a share in HyperLoot as a system developer.<br>
              Buy them on an exchange. We will be list on a few exchanges soon.<br>
              Buy HLTM tokens and join as a master node owner.<br>
              You can participate in the HyperLoot bounty campaign.<br>
			  You can receive investment from HyperLoot fund.
